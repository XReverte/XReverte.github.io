								<p>Empowered by a strong foundation in Data Science and fueled by my enthusiasm for leveraging data to drive innovative solutions, I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to your team and tackle the exciting technological challenges ahead. <a href="https://github.com/XReverte/XReverte.github.io/blob/main/CV_XReverte_pdf.pdf"><b>Take a look at my Curriculum Vitae</b></a>.<br /><br /></p>
								
								<p><h3>Education</h3></p>
								<p>My academic journey, culminating in a <b>Master's degree in Data Science</b> (<b>MDS</b>) from the University of Girona, has bestowed upon me a comprehensive skill set vital for excelling in the dynamic field of data-driven innovation. Proficient in an array of programming languages including <i>Python</i>, <i>R</i>, and <i>SQL</i>, and adept in leveraging cutting-edge tools such as <i>Scikit-learn</i>, <i>TensorFlow</i>, and <i>Fastai</i>, I harbor a keen interest in seamlessly integrating <i>advanced analytics</i> and <i>machine learning methodologies</i> into business frameworks to drive informed decision-making.</p>
								<p>My hands-on experience in developing machine learning models, including <i>Clustering</i>, <i>Support Vector Machines</i>, <i>Boosting techniques</i>, and <i>Neural Networks</i>, complemented by the holistic perspective provided by my <b>Bachelor's degree in Environmental Sciences</b> (<b>B.Sc.</b>), equips me with a <i>distinctive approach</i> to tackling complex challenges. This blend of skills not only allows me to excel in <i>interdisciplinary settings</i> but also empowers me to develop practical and <i>sustainable solutions</i> for modern challenges. I am ready to bring meaningful contributions to your team, leveraging my versatile skill set.<br /><br /></p>
								
								<p><h3>Professional experience</h3></p>
								<p>Throughout my professional journey, I have demonstrated my ability to <i>analyze business needs</i> and deliver <i>rigorous data-driven solutions</i> that drive business impact in a fast-paced environment. During my experiences at <b>Fundació Drissa</b> and <b>Editorial RM</b> I have showcased my ability to <i>work collaboratively</i> in a team environment, <i>adapt quickly</i> to new challenges, and <i>communicate effectively</i> to drive project success. These experiences have reinforced my understanding of the substantial influence data holds in shaping informed decisions and fostering innovation.<br /><br /></p>
								
								<p><h3>Projects</h3></p>
								<p>I am particularly proud of my involvement in projects like the <a href="https://github.com/XReverte/Happiness">'<b><i>Analysis of Influencing Factors on Personal Happiness</i></b>'</a>, where I leveraged <i>clustering techniques</i>, <i>statistical analysis</i>, and <i>supervised machine learning algorithms</i> to unveil underlying patterns in human behavior. Furthermore, my accomplishments in the <a href="https://github.com/XReverte/Image_Classification">'<b><i>CIFAR-10 image classification</i></b>'</a> project highlight my proficiency in attaining outstanding outcomes through the application of <i>transfer learning</i> with pretrained <i>Convolutional Neural Network</i> models. For further insights into these projects and a deeper exploration of my experiences, I encourage you to explore my <a href="https://xreverte.github.io/">portfolio.</a><br /><br /></p>
								
								<p><h3>About Me</h3></p>
								<p>I consider myself a <i>lifelong learner</i>, actively engaging in courses on platforms like DataCamp, where I am currently completing the '<i>Data Scientist Track</i>'. These initiatives keep me up-to-date with new technologies and best practices in the data science realm, strengthening my ability to tackle challenges <i>innovatively</i> and <i>effectively</i>. As an <i>avid learner</i> and <i>strategic thinker</i>, I am committed to <b>staying abreast of emerging technologies</b> and best practices in the field.</p>
								<p>Statistics and data science are perfect companions for <b>self-learning</b>. There are no bad students, only bad teachers, right? So, who better than oneself to be its best teacher? Embracing a self-taught approach stands as one of my most valuable assets, not solely for its inherent <i>independence</i> but also as a catalyst for <i>perpetual growth</i>.</p>
								<p>My <b>passion for chess</b> has honed my <i>strategic planning</i> skills and sharpened my acumen for <i>process optimization</i>. This multifaceted proficiency is evident in my <i>analytical approach</i> and capacity to tackle intricate challenges with dexterity.</p>
								<p>Beyond my professional pursuits, I am an avid <b>sports enthusiast</b>, particularly enjoying activities such as paddle, gym and running. This hobby not only serves as a source of physical well-being but also contribute significantly to my overall happiness and mental clarity. Interestingly, through my involvement in the '<i>Analysis of Influencing Factors on Personal Happiness</i>' project, I confirmed the impact of sports on my personal happiness, reinforcing my commitment to maintaining a <i>balanced lifestyle</i>.</p>
								<p>As the world becomes increasingly reliant on technology, the capacity to make data-informed decisions has emerged as an indispensable skill. I am excited about the opportunities the future holds for me and am always open to new connections and collaborations.<br /><br /></p>
