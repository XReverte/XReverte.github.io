								<p><h3>Education</h3></p>
								<p>My academic journey, culminating in a <b>Master's degree in Data Science</b> (<b>MDS</b>) from the University of Girona, has bestowed upon me a comprehensive skill set vital for excelling in the dynamic field of data-driven innovation. Proficient in an array of programming languages including <i>Python</i>, <i>R</i>, and <i>SQL</i>, and adept in leveraging cutting-edge tools such as <i>Scikit-learn</i>, <i>TensorFlow</i>, and <i>Fastai</i>, I harbor a keen interest in seamlessly integrating <i>advanced analytics</i> and <i>machine learning methodologies</i> into business frameworks to drive informed decision-making.</p>
								<p>My hands-on experience in developing machine learning models, including <i>Clustering</i>, <i>Support Vector Machines</i>, <i>Boosting techniques</i>, and <i>Neural Networks</i>, complemented by the holistic perspective provided by my <b>Bachelor's degree in Environmental Sciences</b> (<b>B.Sc.</b>), equips me with a <i>distinctive approach</i> to tackling complex challenges. This blend of skills not only allows me to excel in <i>interdisciplinary settings</i> but also empowers me to develop practical and <i>sustainable solutions</i> for modern challenges. I am ready to bring meaningful contributions to your team, leveraging my versatile skill set.<br /><br /></p>
								
								<p><h3>Professional experience</h3></p>
								<p>Throughout my professional journey, I have demonstrated my ability to <i>analyze business needs</i> and deliver <i><b>rigorous data-driven solutions</b></i> that drive business impact in a fast-paced environment. During my experiences I have showcased my ability to <i><b>work collaboratively</b></i> in a team environment, <i>adapt quickly</i> to new challenges, and <i><b>communicate effectively</b></i> to drive project success. These experiences have reinforced my understanding of the substantial influence data holds in shaping informed decisions and fostering innovation.</p>
								<p>In my role as a <b>Data Scientist at Fundació Privada Drissa</b>, I spearheaded the development of an automated data capture, adequacy, and analysis system. This initiative resulted in a significant <b>enhancement of data quality</b> and the <b>streamlining of data utilization processes</b>, ultimately driving project innovation, reducing workload, and improving overall project outcomes and operational effectiveness. Additionally, I made contributions to enhancing website maintenance efficiency by implementing <b>time-saving procedures</b>, such as automating periodic .txt file generation for website updates."</p>
								<p>As a <b>Data Processor at Editorial RM</b>, I played a pivotal role in <b>enhancing the publisher's data quality</b> through meticulous processing and alignment of information pertaining to the technical and physical characteristics of titles. Leveraging my analytical skills, I adeptly <b>extracted valuable insights</b> from the data, providing actionable information to support company objectives and decision-making processes.</p>
								<p>As an independent professional, I contributed to the <b>ReSource collaboration project</b>, which aimed to tackle rural depopulation through awareness and collaboration. By <b>designing a survey</b> and implementing a <b>segmentation methodology</b>, I effectively categorized participants based on survey data. This approach <b>facilitated diverse group dynamics</b>, enriching the collaborative process and fostering innovative solutions. Through insightful conferences and critical discussions, we significantly <b>raised community awareness</b> and addressed this pressing issue.<br /><br /></p>

								<p><h3>Lifelong Learning Philosophy</h3></p>
								<p>My lifelong learning philosophy is rooted in the belief that <b>true growth transcends traditional educational backgrounds and professional experience</b>. I am not satisfied with merely achieving academic and career milestones; I am driven by a continuous quest for knowledge and self-improvement. This approach not only fuels my personal development but also enhances my capabilities as a data scientist. I strive to evolve constantly, seeking new opportunities to learn, adapt, and excel.</p>
								<p>To embody this philosophy, I actively engage in various learning endeavors. I pursue <b>additional coursework</b> to deepen my technical expertise and <i>stay abreast of the latest advancements in data science</i>. <b>Personal projects</b> allow me to <i>explore innovative ideas and apply theoretical knowledge to real-world challenges</i>. <b>Reflective reading</b> broadens my perspectives and <i>hones my critical thinking skills</i>. <b>Playing chess</b> <i>sharpens my strategic thinking and problem-solving abilities</i>.</p>
								<p>This relentless pursuit of knowledge fosters innovation, critical thinking, and strategic insight, making me a more <b>effective and versatile data scientist</b>. To explore how this philosophy has shaped my achievements, I invite you to visit the <a href="Logbook.html"><b>LogBook</b></a> section of my portfolio, where you can delve deeper into my continuous learning journey.<br /><br /></p>
								
								<p><h3>About Me</h3></p>
								<p><b><i>'Self-learning as the best tool for personal growth, data science as the best tool for self-teaching'</i></b>. There are no bad students, only bad teachers, right? So, who better than oneself to be its best teacher? Embracing a self-taught approach stands as one of my most valuable assets, not solely for its inherent <i>independence</i> but also as a catalyst for <i>perpetual growth</i>.</p>
								<p><b><i>'Constant learning fuels my journey in data science'</i></b>. I consider myself a <i>lifelong learner</i>, actively engaging in courses on platforms like DataCamp, where I am currently completing the '<i>Data Scientist Track</i>'. These initiatives keep me up-to-date with new technologies and best practices in the data science realm, strengthening my ability to tackle challenges <i>innovatively</i> and <i>effectively</i>.</p>
								<p><b><i>'In life as in chess: adaptability and anticipation, critical and strategical thinking'</i></b>. My passion for chess has honed my <i>strategic planning</i> skills and sharpened my acumen for <i>process optimization</i>. This multifaceted proficiency is evident in my <i>analytical approach</i> and capacity to tackle intricate challenges with dexterity.</p>
								<p><b><i>'happiness = personal.query("healthy_mind & healthy_body")'</i></b>. Beyond my professional pursuits, I am an avid <i>sports enthusiast</i>, particularly enjoying activities such as paddle, gym and running. This hobby not only serves as a source of physical well-being but also contribute significantly to my overall happiness and mental clarity. Interestingly, through my involvement in the '<i>Analysis of Influencing Factors on Personal Happiness</i>' project, I confirmed the impact of sports on my personal happiness, reinforcing my commitment to maintaining a <i>balanced lifestyle</i>.</p>
								<p>As the world becomes increasingly reliant on technology, the capacity to make data-informed decisions has emerged as an indispensable skill. I am excited about the opportunities the future holds for me and am always open to new connections and collaborations.<br /><br /></p>
